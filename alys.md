Alys is an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain designed to extend the Bitcoin ecosystem with EVM-based smart contract capabilities. Fully supporting all ERC standards, Alys empowers developers to create a wide range of applications and blockchain solutions, such as real-world asset tokenization, payment platforms, loyalty programs, etc. The native asset of Alys, ALYS, is pegged 1:1 with bitcoin. ALYS is used to pay for gas, providing a seamless integration with the broader Bitcoin ecosystem.  
 
Alys employs a hybrid Proof-of-Work / Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism to provide both security and efficiency. This approach leverages the strengths of both consensus methods, directly compensating mainchain Bitcoin miners and providing faster transaction finality. Developers familiar with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) will find an equivalent experience in Alys. Alys is fully EVM-compatible, which means that any ERC standard can be implemented. 
 
To get started with Alys, users peg in tBTC (Testnet bitcoin) with the Collective, a consortium of entities recruited to administer peg ins and peg outs to Anduro sidechains. For your convenience, Anduro maintains an tALYS faucet. A supermajority of the Collective secures funds deposited into Alys. After pegging in, users receive ALYS tokens, which can be used to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the Alys sidechain.  

Alys is actively being developed, and we invite creators to join our community, stay updated on our progress, and be among the first to build on this uniquely Bitcoin-native sidechain.  

*Anduro sidechains remain in a closed beta. Registrants of this hackathon will be receiving exclusive pre-launch access and are among the first to innovate on the Anduro ecosystem*
